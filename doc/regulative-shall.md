# How Did "Shall" Get In So Much Trouble?

A century or two ago, it was everywhere. Today, it's practically
verboten. American drafting expert Ken Adams is vehement. Don't use
"shall". Say "must" instead. Commonwealth legislative drafters agree.
Just Say No To Shall.

I agree too. But I always wondered: why? Let me share my guess.

(This is just one programmer's personal opinion. It's not as well
researched as I'd like; and that's why this is a random article and
not published in a peer-reviewed law journal.)

I think it has to do with time. Drafting-time versus executed-time.

Drafters writing a contract, or a bill, are thinking: "after this
contract is signed, or after the bill is passed, everything here will
be in effect; but until then, I'm in the present, talking about a
future that hasn't happened yet."

So they say "shall"!

## Shall Mean

"For the purposes of this section, weekend shall mean a Saturday or
Sunday". They mean: "after this is signed, weekend shall mean a
Saturday or Sunday."

And that makes perfect sense, especially if you think of a contract
draft being negotiated and emailed around between the counterparties.

But after the contract is signed and the bill is passed, people
reading the text of the definition are confused: "why didn't you just
say that weekend means Saturday or Sunday"?

The drafter's response: because at the time I wrote that, it wasn't in
effect, so saying that it means whatever, would have been incorrect.

## Shall Do

This becomes even worse when we talk about the parties and their
obligations.

The text is written before signing, but read after signing.

And that creates a situation where "party shall do" means two
different things!

At the time of drafting, it meant: "after this is signed, we expect
the party to do this thing right away."

But when read after execution, the party could read it as "yeah, we
shall do this thing. Tomorrow. Or maybe the day after. Or in a month
or year, really, because the contract doesn't give a deadline!"
