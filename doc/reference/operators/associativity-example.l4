-- Example: Operator associativity
-- Demonstrates left and right associative operators

-- Left-associative: subtraction
a MEANS 10
b MEANS 3
c MEANS 2

#EVAL a MINUS b MINUS c
-- Evaluates as: (10 - 3) - 2 = 5

-- Right-associative: list cons
#EVAL 1 FOLLOWED BY 2 FOLLOWED BY 3 FOLLOWED BY EMPTY
-- Evaluates as: 1 FOLLOWED BY (2 FOLLOWED BY (3 FOLLOWED BY EMPTY))
