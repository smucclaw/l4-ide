End-users typically come to an L4-based application with these questions in mind:
- Do I qualify? Why? Why not?
- How much do I have to pay? Why?
- How much do I get paid? Why?
- What situation am I in?
- If I want to achieve (or avoid) some future, what do I need to do next?
- Can you generate some paperwork for me to sign?
