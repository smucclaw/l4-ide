## Algebraic Types

This is how we get Optional, or Maybe.

## Lists

### Collections: Lists

Lists are created using the `LIST` keyword and can be manipulated using standard list operations.

```l4
GIVETH A LIST OF NUMBER
primes MEANS LIST 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
```

If your comma key is broken, lists can go down the page instead:

```l4
GIVETH A LIST OF NUMBER
primes MEANS LIST 2
                  3
                  5
                  7
                  11
```
