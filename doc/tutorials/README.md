## Tutorial Format

Each tutorial includes:

- **Audience:** Who this tutorial is for

## How Tutorials Differ from Courses

- **Tutorials** are task-focused: "How do I do X?"
- **Courses** are learning-focused: "Teach me about Y"

**Example:**
- Tutorial: "How to build a decision service API" (task)
- Course: "Module 4: Understanding Decision Services" (learning)

Use tutorials when you have a specific goal. Use courses when you want to learn systematically.
