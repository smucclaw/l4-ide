# -- Dec 18 2024: Prioritizing (short) examples
# where either it's not obvious how it should be handled by our DSL,
# or there is some flexibility in how it could be handled.
# I am also mostly ignoring things that are clearly defeasibility-related for now,
# since that's something that can be tackled after we've got the core language working.
# Not worrying about syntactical niceties that can probably be resolved as and when they come up either.

          2. If we do want to have it come after, how would we handle that?
          Would it be handled by an annotation mechanism where the annotation need not be directly bundled with the thing being annotated in the syntax
          (e.g. like how you can annotate a top-level expression's type with `::` in Haskell without having to do it at the exact same place that you define the expression)?
