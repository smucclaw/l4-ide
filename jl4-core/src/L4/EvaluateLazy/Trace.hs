-- Note [Lazy evaluation tracing]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- The *goal* of lazy evaluation tracing is to produce an evaluation trace
-- that looks roughly like a trace would look in an eager language. In particular,
-- the evaluation of bindings should be in the trace where those bindings are
-- *allocated* (this means, e.g. function args should be evaluated at the call
-- site of the function, and let-bindings should be evaluated where those
-- bindings happen syntactically).
--
-- Of course, lazy evaluation means that some of these might not get evaluated
-- at all. We don't want lazy evaluation traces to cause additional evaluation.
-- Instead, we will mark unevaluated bindings as such.
--
-- In order to get the order correct, we perform reordering of the trace. We
-- remember allocations. Once we force thunks, we also remember that we are doing
-- so. We later go through the trace actions produced during the evaluations
-- and try to figure out where an allocated value has been evaluated and insert
-- that part of the trace at the point of allocation.
--
-- The process proceeds in multiple phases:
--
-- 1. During evaluation, we generate a list of 'EvalTraceAction's. This is
-- the only part that happens during evaluation. It's a design goal that this
-- can be turned off easily, and also that even if it's on, it on its own
-- should not cause a lot of overhead. (It should e.g. be possible to write
-- the trace actions into a file and then have negligible memory and time cost.)
--
-- Current info:
-- @
--   [EvalTraceAction]
-- @
--
-- All the rest of the process happens after evaluation.
--
-- 2. We split the list of 'EvalTraceAction's into several sublist, each of
-- which is associated with an *address*. The split happens at points where we
-- start evaluating a possible thunk. This is done by 'splitEvalTraceActions'.
-- The result of this is a finite map that associates the addresses with the
-- respective sub action lists. The main expression is associated with 'Nothing'.
--
-- Current info:
-- @
--   Map (Maybe Address) (Either WHNF [EvalTraceAction])
-- @
--
-- 3. Every list of actions is turned into a trace with placeholders.
-- For every alloc action, we introduce a placeholder for that address.
-- For every setref action, we introduce a placeholder for the value
-- belonging to that address. We keep WHNFs where eventually NFs are
-- expected.
--
-- @
--   [EvalTraceAction] -> EvalPreTrace
-- @
--
-- 4. We "zonk" the whole structure, by replacing placeholders correspondingly,
-- and turning WHNFs into NFs.
--
-- @
--   Map (Maybe Address) (Either WHNF EvalPreTrace) -> EvalPreTrace -> EvalTrace
-- @
--
-- 5. We simplify the trace by removing some trivial nodes.

-- | 'EvalTraceAction's are optionally generated during evaluation. The idea is that
-- they are themselves not extremely large (i.e., they don't contain unbounded data;
-- we omit any stacks or environments), yet they still should contain sufficient
-- information so that we can recover a meaningful evaluation trace via posprocessing.
