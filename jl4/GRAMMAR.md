# JL4 language context-free grammar

We use the following meta-notation for
separated lists:
```
foo{sep}* ::=
    epsilon             -- the empty symbol
  | foo "sep" foo{sep}*
```
Most of these can be replaced using layout / indentation,
see further below.

```

param ::=
  name ("IS" type)?

reqparam ::=
  name "IS" type

article ::=
  "A" | "AN" | "THE"

declare' ::=
  "DECLARE" appform typedecl

typedecl ::=

recorddecl ::=
  "HAS" reqparam{,}*

enumdecl ::=
  "IS" "ONE" "OF"
    condecl{,}*

condecl ::=

  | expr "'s" name                     -- record projection
  | "THE" name "OF" expr               -- also record projection (under discussion / should perhaps become generally possible as application syntax)
  | "IF" expr "THEN" expr "ELSE" expr  -- elimination for Booleans
  | "CONSIDER" expr branches           -- elimination for general datatypes

  | ...                                -- string literals (in double quotes)

-- All operators have a textual form, but some may also have
-- a symbolic form. These have to be built-in for now (not *necessarily*
-- keywords), because operators currently cannot be user-defined.

# Some remarks on ambiguity and layout

```
DECLARE FOO IS ONE OF con1 HAS x IS A BOOL, y IS A NUMBER, con2
```

Disambiguation with layout:
```
DECLARE FOO IS ONE OF
  con1 HAS
    x IS A BOOL
    y IS A NUMBER
  con2
```

Disambiguation with parentheses:

There are in principle two options:
```
DECLARE FOO IS ONE OF (con1 HAS x IS A BOOL, y IS A NUMBER), con2
DECLARE FOO IS ONE OF con1 HAS (x IS A BOOL, y IS A NUMBER), con2
```
We will go for the first option.

Annotations are treated just as lexical comments.

Line comments start with `--`.
Block comments start with `{-` and end with `-}`.

# Layout

Principle 1:

Every use of `{...}` in the grammar can be replaced with
layout, basically putting every element of the sequence on
a new line and omitting the separator.

Principle 2:

Do something sensible with layout of infix operators for
expressions. (I know this is not a real spec yet.)

# Annotations

We have initially three kinds of annotations:

- general comments,
- NLG hints,
- and references.

For NLG hints, we allow to write them as a comment
starting with `@nlg` or within square brackets.

For references, we allow to write them as a comment
starting with `@ref` or within double angle brackets.

Annotations for specific entities refer to whatever
precedes them.
