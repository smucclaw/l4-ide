    There are multiple definitions for the identifier

      x

    and I do not have sufficient information to make a choice between them.
    The options are:

      x (defined at literal-patterns.l4:1:1-2) of type NUMBER
      x (defined at literal-patterns.l4:3:31-32) of type FUNCTION FROM Foo TO NUMBER

    I could not find a definition for the idenfier

      bing

    in a pattern match. This could mean that the type

      Foo

    doesn't have a constructor with that name, or you were trying to use
    a function with that name, which is not in scope.
