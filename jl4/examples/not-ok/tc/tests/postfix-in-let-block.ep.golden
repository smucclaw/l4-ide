§ `Postfix Operator in LET Block - Not Supported`

-- This file demonstrates that postfix mixfix operators CANNOT be defined in LET blocks.
-- They MUST be defined in WHERE clauses to be registered in the mixfix operator registry.

IMPORT prelude

-- This should error: postfix mixfix operators cannot be defined in LET blocks
GIVEN radius IS A NUMBER
GIVETH A NUMBER
circleAreaBroken radius MEANS
  LET pi BE 3
      r `squared` MEANS r * r  -- ERROR: mixfix operators not supported in LET
  IN radius `squared` TIMES pi

-- The correct way is to use WHERE instead of LET for mixfix operator definitions:
-- GIVEN radius IS A NUMBER
-- GIVETH A NUMBER
-- circleAreaCorrect radius MEANS
--   LET pi BE 3
--   IN radius `squared` TIMES pi
--   WHERE
--     GIVEN r IS A NUMBER
--     r `squared` MEANS r * r

-- Or use a regular function in LET (without mixfix syntax):
-- GIVEN radius IS A NUMBER
-- GIVETH A NUMBER
-- circleAreaWithFunction radius MEANS
--   LET pi BE 3
--       squared r IS r * r
--   IN squared radius TIMES pi
