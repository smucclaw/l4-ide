  I found a problem while checking the definition of `example`:
    All elements in a LIST literal must have the same type.
    From looking at the context, I have inferred that this type must be
    
      FUNCTION FROM BOOLEAN TO BOOLEAN
    
    but this element is of type
    
      FUNCTION FROM NUMBER TO BOOLEAN
