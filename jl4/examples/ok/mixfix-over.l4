§ `Infix Map (over) - Haskell <$> equivalent`

-- This file demonstrates using mixfix to create an infix version of map,
-- similar to Haskell's <$> operator.
-- Instead of: map myfunction mylist
-- We can write: myfunction `over` mylist

-- First, define the standard map function for built-in lists
GIVEN a IS A TYPE
      b IS A TYPE
      f IS A FUNCTION FROM a TO b
      list IS A LIST OF a
GIVETH A LIST OF b
map f list MEANS
  CONSIDER list
    WHEN EMPTY THEN EMPTY
    WHEN x FOLLOWED BY xs THEN f x FOLLOWED BY map f xs

-- Now define `over` as a mixfix infix operator that aliases map
-- Pattern: f `over` list
-- This gives us Haskell's <$> semantics: f <$> xs = fmap f xs

GIVEN a IS A TYPE
      b IS A TYPE
      f IS A FUNCTION FROM a TO b
      list IS A LIST OF a
GIVETH A LIST OF b
f `over` list MEANS map f list

-- Helper functions for testing
GIVEN x IS A NUMBER
GIVETH NUMBER
double x MEANS x * 2

GIVEN x IS A NUMBER
GIVETH NUMBER
square x MEANS x * x

GIVEN x IS A NUMBER
GIVETH NUMBER
addOne x MEANS x + 1

-- Test data
testList MEANS LIST 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

-- Test 1: Using map in prefix form (traditional)
testMapPrefix MEANS map double testList

#EVAL map double testList

-- Test 2: Using over in infix form (new!)
-- Note: Parentheses around the function prevent it from being parsed as a function application
testOverInfix MEANS (double) `over` testList

#EVAL (double) `over` testList

-- Test 3: Chaining - since `over` returns a list, we can chain
-- In Haskell: addOne <$> (double <$> [1,2,3])
testChained MEANS (addOne) `over` ((double) `over` testList)

#EVAL (addOne) `over` ((double) `over` testList)

-- Test 4: With square function
testSquare MEANS (square) `over` testList

#EVAL (square) `over` testList

-- Test 5: Empty list case
testEmpty MEANS (double) `over` EMPTY

#EVAL (double) `over` EMPTY

-- Test 6: Single element list
testSingle MEANS (double) `over` (LIST 42)

#EVAL (double) `over` (LIST 42)

-- Test 7: Prefix syntax still works
testOverPrefix MEANS `over` square testList

#EVAL `over` square testList
