§ `Mixfix Multiline Regression`

-- Verifies that mixfix/postfix operators can be invoked across multiple
-- lines when keywords stay aligned with the operand indentation.

IMPORT prelude

GIVEN radius IS A NUMBER
radius squared MEANS radius * radius

GIVEN base IS A NUMBER
      exponent IS A NUMBER
base `raised to` exponent MEANS base * exponent

GIVEN payer IS A NUMBER
      payee IS A NUMBER
      ledger IS A NUMBER
payer `remits` payee `to settle` ledger MEANS payer + payee + ledger

DECIDE demo_multiline_postfix radius IS
  radius
  `squared`

DECIDE demo_multiline_mixfix base exponent IS
  base
  `raised to`
  exponent

DECIDE demo_multiline_chain payer payee ledger IS
  payer
  `remits`
  payee
  `to settle`
  ledger
