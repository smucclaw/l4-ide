-- LET...IN inline expression tests
-- Tests that LET expressions work correctly within parentheses on a single line
-- (Codex Issue 1 claimed these would fail due to indentation - this was incorrect)

-- Simple inline LET
DECIDE testInline1 IS (LET x IS 5 IN x)

-- Inline LET with arithmetic
DECIDE testInline2 IS (LET x IS 5 IN x PLUS x)

-- Inline LET in larger expression
DECIDE testInline3 IS 10 PLUS (LET y IS 3 IN y TIMES 2)

-- Multiple inline LETs in one expression
DECIDE testInline4 IS (LET a IS 2 IN a) PLUS (LET b IS 3 IN b)

-- Nested inline LETs
DECIDE testInline5 IS (LET x IS (LET y IS 5 IN y) IN x TIMES 2)

-- Inline LET with parameterized function
DECIDE testInline6 IS (LET double n IS n TIMES 2 IN double 7)

-- Deeply nested inline
DECIDE testInline7 IS (LET a IS (LET b IS (LET c IS 3 IN c) IN b TIMES 2) IN a PLUS 1)
