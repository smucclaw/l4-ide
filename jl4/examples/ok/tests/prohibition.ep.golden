-- =============================================================================
-- Behavior Tests using #TRACE
-- =============================================================================
-- NOTE: As of Phase 1-3 implementation, only PARSING is complete.
-- The evaluator does not yet distinguish MUST vs MUST NOT/SHANT semantics.
-- Current behavior: SHANT/MUST NOT are parsed but evaluated as MUST.
-- TODO: Implement Phase 4+ to make prohibition semantics work correctly.

-- Test 1: SHANT compliance - party does NOT do prohibited action (should be OK)
-- Expected (future): FULFILLED (no breach because Alice didn't smoke)
-- Current: Shows as pending MUST obligation (semantics not implemented)
#TRACE noSmoking AT 0 WITH

-- Test 2: SHANT breach - party DOES the prohibited action
-- Expected (future): BREACH (Alice smoked, violating prohibition)
-- Current: FULFILLED (incorrectly treats smoking as fulfilling obligation)
#TRACE noSmoking AT 0 WITH
  PARTY 15

-- Test 3: MUST NOT compliance - party does NOT do prohibited action
-- Expected (future): FULFILLED
-- Current: Shows as pending MUST obligation
DOES Alice AT smoke #TRACE noDrinking AT 0 WITH

-- Test 4: MUST NOT breach - party DOES the prohibited action
-- Expected (future): BREACH (Bob drank, violating prohibition)
-- Current: FULFILLED (incorrectly treats drinking as fulfilling obligation)
#TRACE noDrinking AT 0 WITH
  PARTY 10

-- Test 5: MUST obligation - party fulfills obligation
-- Expected: FULFILLED (correct - this is obligation semantics)
DOES Bob AT drink #TRACE mustDrink AT 0 WITH
  PARTY 15

-- Test 6: MUST obligation - party fails to fulfill obligation
-- Expected: Shows pending obligation (deadline not reached)
DOES Alice AT drink #TRACE mustDrink AT 0 WITH

-- Test 7: MAY permission - party exercises permission
-- Expected: FULFILLED (exercised permission is fine)
#TRACE mayDrink AT 0 WITH
  PARTY 15

-- Test 8: MAY permission - party does not exercise permission
-- Expected: FULFILLED (not exercising permission is also fine)
-- Current: Shows pending (MAY semantics also need refinement)
DOES Bob AT drink #TRACE mayDrink AT 0 WITH
