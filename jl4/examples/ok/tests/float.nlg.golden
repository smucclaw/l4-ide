`pi`
`euler`
`pi`
the sum of `pi` and `euler`
the difference between `pi` and the product of `pi` and `euler`
the result of dividing `pi` by `euler`
the result of dividing 5 by 0
the result of dividing 5 by 0
the result of 10 modulo 5
the result of 10 modulo 5
the result of 0.5 modulo 5
the result of 5 modulo 0
5 is equal to 5
5 is equal to 5
the sum of 0.1 and 0.2
the sum of 0.1 and 0.2 is equal to 0.3
0.0000001
the sum of `ROUND` with `pi` and `FLOOR` with `pi`
the sum of `pi` and the product of `ROUND` with `pi` and `pi`
the product of `FLOOR` with `pi` and `FLOOR` with `pi`
`CEILING` with `pi`
`IS INTEGER`
`IS INTEGER` with `pi`
`IS INTEGER` with 2
`IS INTEGER` with 2
`IS INTEGER` with 2.00000001
consider the case distinctions of `IS INTEGER` with `pi` :  when `TRUE` has  then `pi`. when `FALSE` has  then the sum of 0.1 and 0.2
