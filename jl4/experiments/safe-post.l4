-- If any of the Company’s securityholders are given a choice as to the form and amount of Proceeds to be received in a Liquidity Event,
-- the Investor will be given the same choice, provided that
--           the Investor may not choose to receive a form of consideration
--             that the Investor would be ineligible to receive as a result of

-- Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with a Change of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, the Company may reduce the cash portion of Proceeds payable to the Investor by the amount determined by its board of directors in good faith for such Change of Control to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, provided that such reduction (A) does not reduce the total Proceeds payable to such Investor and (B) is applied in the same manner and on a pro rata basis to all securityholders who have equal priority to the Investor under Section 1(d).

§§§ `Dissolution Event`

-- (c)	Dissolution Event. If there is a Dissolution Event before the termination of this Safe, the Investor will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds equal to the Cash-Out Amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event.

§§§ `Termination Event`

-- (e)	Termination.
-- This Safe will automatically terminate (without relieving the Company of any obligations arising from a prior breach of or non-compliance with this Safe)

-- (i) the issuance of Capital Shares to the Investor pursuant to the automatic conversion of this Safe under Section 1(a); or
