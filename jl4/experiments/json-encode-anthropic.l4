// Example: Encoding a request for Anthropic Claude API
// This demonstrates building a JSON request body for the Claude Messages API

DECLARE `Message` HAS
  `role`    IS A STRING
  `content` IS A STRING

GIVEN role IS A STRING
      content IS A STRING
createMessage MEANS
  `Message` WITH
    `role` IS role
    `content` IS content

DECIDE userMessage IS
  createMessage "user" "Does this cosmetic claim violate regulations: 'Treats acne permanently'?"

// For now we'll encode just the message
// In the future, we can build the full API request structure
DECIDE encodeMessage IS
  JSONENCODE userMessage

#EVAL encodeMessage

// Once we have full record support, we can do:
DECLARE `API Request` HAS
  `model`      IS A STRING
  `max_tokens` IS A NUMBER
  `messages`   IS A LIST OF `Message`

DECIDE apiRequest IS
  `API Request` WITH
    `model`      IS "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
    `max_tokens` IS 500
    `messages`   IS LIST userMessage

requestBody MEANS
  JSONENCODE apiRequest

#EVAL requestBody
