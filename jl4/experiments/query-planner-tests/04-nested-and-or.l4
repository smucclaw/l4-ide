-- Level 4: Nested AND/OR combinations
-- Formula: (a AND b) OR (c AND (d OR e))
-- Tests more complex nesting and partial evaluation
-- Expected behavior:
--   a=true, b=true:     determined True, c/d/e are don't-care
--   c=false:            still needs a and b, d and e are don't-care
--   c=true, d=true:     determined True, a/b/e are don't-care
--   c=true, e=true:     determined True, a/b/d are don't-care
--   c=true, d=false:    still needs a, b, and e
--   c=true, d=false, e=false: still needs a and b
--   a=false, c=false:   determined False, b/d/e are don't-care
--   a=false, c=true, d=false, e=false: determined False, b is don't-care

GIVEN a IS A BOOLEAN @desc first var in left branch
      b IS A BOOLEAN @desc second var in left branch
      c IS A BOOLEAN @desc first var in right branch
      d IS A BOOLEAN @desc first option in nested OR

GIVETH A BOOLEAN
DECIDE `complex nested result` IF (a AND b) OR (c AND (d OR e))
