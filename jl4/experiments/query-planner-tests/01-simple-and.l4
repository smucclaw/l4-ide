-- Level 1: Simple AND operation
-- Expected behavior:
--   No bindings: asks for both a and b
--   a=true:  still needs b (True AND Unknown = Unknown)
--   a=false: determined False (False AND Unknown = False, short-circuit)
--   b=true:  still needs a (Unknown AND True = Unknown)
--   b=false: determined False (short-circuit)

@export default Test simple AND operation
GIVEN a IS A BOOLEAN @desc the first boolean variable
      b IS A BOOLEAN @desc the second boolean variable
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
DECIDE `simple and result` IF a AND b
