-- Level 3: Don't-care in conditional branches
-- Formula: (condition AND consequence) OR (NOT condition AND alternative)
-- This pattern appears in if-then-else: "if condition then consequence else alternative"
-- Expected behavior:
--   condition=true:  still needs consequence, alternative is don't-care
--   condition=false: still needs alternative, consequence is don't-care
--   consequence=true, alternative=true: determined True, condition is don't-care

@export default Test don't-care in if-then-else pattern
GIVEN condition    IS A BOOLEAN @desc the condition to test
      consequence  IS A BOOLEAN @desc what happens if condition is true
      alternative  IS A BOOLEAN @desc what happens if condition is false
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
DECIDE `if-then-else result` IF
  (condition AND consequence) OR (NOT condition AND alternative)
