-- Level 2: AND short-circuit test
-- Formula: a AND b AND c
-- Tests that when any variable is false, the others become don't-care
-- Expected behavior:
--   a=false: determined False, b and c are don't-care
--   b=false: determined False, a and c are don't-care (if a is unknown)
--   c=false: determined False, a and b are don't-care (if both unknown)
--   a=true:  still needs b and c
--   a=true, b=true: still needs c
--   a=true, b=true, c=true: determined True

@export default Test AND short-circuiting
GIVEN a IS A BOOLEAN @desc first condition
      b IS A BOOLEAN @desc second condition
      c IS A BOOLEAN @desc third condition
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
DECIDE `all conditions met` IF a AND b AND c
