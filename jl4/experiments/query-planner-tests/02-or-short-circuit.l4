-- Level 2: OR short-circuit test
-- Formula: a OR b OR c
-- Tests that when any variable is true, the others become don't-care
-- Expected behavior:
--   a=true:  determined True, b and c are don't-care
--   b=true:  determined True, a and c are don't-care (if a is unknown)
--   c=true:  determined True, a and b are don't-care (if both unknown)
--   a=false: still needs b and c
--   a=false, b=false: still needs c
--   a=false, b=false, c=false: determined False

@export default Test OR short-circuiting
GIVEN a IS A BOOLEAN @desc first condition
      b IS A BOOLEAN @desc second condition
      c IS A BOOLEAN @desc third condition
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
DECIDE `any condition met` IF a OR b OR c
