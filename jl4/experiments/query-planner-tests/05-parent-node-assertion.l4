-- Level 5: Parent Node Assertion
-- Formula: A AND (B OR C)
-- Tests the ability to answer at the level of parent expressions
--
-- Expected behaviors:
--   User can assert: "(B OR C) = true" without specifying B or C individually
--   User can assert: "A = true" separately
--   If user asserts both parent nodes are true, we get True without needing B or C details
--
-- This is important for privacy and user experience:
--   - User may know the disjunction is satisfied without wanting to reveal which branch
--   - User may be uncertain about details but certain about the aggregate
--
-- The query planner should support bindings at different expression levels:
--   1. Leaf level: {"label": {"a": true, "b": true}}
--   2. Parent level: {"label": {"b_or_c": true}}  (where b_or_c is the label for (B OR C))
--   3. Mixed: {"label": {"a": true, "b_or_c": true}}
