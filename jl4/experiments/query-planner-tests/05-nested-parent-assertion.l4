-- Level 5: Nested Parent Node Assertion
-- Formula: (A AND B) OR (C AND (D OR E))
-- Tests ability to answer at multiple levels of nesting
--
-- Possible assertion levels:
--   1. Leaf: a, b, c, d, e
--   2. First level: (a AND b), (d OR e)
--   3. Second level: (c AND (d OR e))
--   4. Top level: entire expression
--
-- Example user assertions:
--   - "I satisfy the left branch" -> (a AND b) = true
--   - "I satisfy the right branch" -> (c AND (d OR e)) = true
--   - "I satisfy one of the inner conditions" -> (d OR e) = true
--
-- This is especially useful for:
--   - Privacy: "I meet the qualifications" without revealing which
--   - Compound documents: "Section 3.2 is satisfied" without all sub-clauses
--   - Expert systems: "This diagnosis is confirmed" without all symptoms
