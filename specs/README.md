# L4 Development Specifications

This directory contains technical specifications for L4 language features and tooling.

## Directory Structure

- **`todo/`** - Specifications for features in progress or planned
- **`done/`** - Completed specifications (for reference)
- **`proposals/`** - Design proposals and RFCs for discussion
- **`roadmap/`** - Future/aspirational features and long-term plans

## Workflow

1. New features start as a proposal in `proposals/`
2. Approved proposals become specs in `todo/`
3. Completed implementations move specs to `done/`

## Naming Convention

- Use UPPERCASE-KEBAB-CASE for spec files: `FEATURE-NAME-SPEC.md`
- Include status, dates, and scope at the top of each spec



See `/docs` for user-facing documentation.
