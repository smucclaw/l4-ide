# -- Dec 18 2024: Prioritizing (short) examples
# where either it's not obvious how it should be handled by our DSL,
# or there is some flexibility in how it could be handled.
# I am also mostly ignoring things that are clearly defeasibility-related for now,
# since that's something that can be tackled after we've got the core language working.
# Not worrying about syntactical niceties that can probably be resolved as and when they come up either.

# `name` is best thought of as being a descriptive, readable-to-humans title, rather than an 'id'

        (1) A person who keeps a dog at the person's home must display a sign that –
          (a)	is legible from the nearest road that gives access to the home; and
          (b)	informs the public that a dog is kept at the home.
        (2)	Paragraph (1) does not apply to a dog that -
          (a)	is kept by a farmer;
          (b)	is not a spaniel or a labrador; and
          (c)	is registered under this Act.
        (3)	In paragraph (2) "farmer" means a person who works in an agricultural business.

          2. If we do want to have it come after, how would we handle that? Would it be handled by an annotation mechanism where the annotation need not be directly bundled with the thing being annotated in the syntax (e.g. like how you can annotate a top-level expression's type with `::` in Haskell without having to do it at the exact same place that you define the expression)?
          Or is this better handled by whatever mechanism we will use (in the future) to handle defeasibility/exceptions?",

          I've seen examples of legislation where there's a very explicit phrase like 'commits an offence'.
          But there's also examples where there may not be an explicit phrase like that next to the offence-creating provision or definition of the offence (but it's either clear from the nature of the penalty or logically implied by the conjunction of the provisions with some auxiliary provision)." }
  excerpts:
    - sources: [examples_for_parsing]
      example: "An entity or other person, that contravenes paragraph (2), (4) or (6), commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term of 2 years and to a fine."

      example: "378.  Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft [...] 379.  Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both."

        A pre-emptive obligation is (i) an achievement obligation that (ii) can be fulfilled even before the obligation comes into force. (An achievement obligation to phi is an obligation where as long as you phi at least once, you count as fulfilling the obligation.)

        > Clause (d) in this example describes that the preemptive obligation enters into force when a financial transanction happens, and the clause explicitly requires the report to be submitted to the relevant authority before the actual transaction (phyiscal movement of the currency) occurs.
